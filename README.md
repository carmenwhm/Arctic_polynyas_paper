# Arctic_polynyas_paper
This repository consists of the Python scripts used for the manuscript 'The spatio-temporal variability, trends, and drivers of winter Arctic polynyas', submitted to the *Journal of Climate*.

'Polynyas_trend_function_SMMR.py' consists of the polynya detection algorithm. 'SMMR_polynya.py' provides an example using the algorithm to detect Arctic polynyas from SMMR, SSM/I and SSMIS sea ice concentration dataset. The sea ice concentration dataset is accessible at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) via https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0051/versions/2.

Other sea ice product results can be provided by request.
